# pgn-reader
This was a homework assignment in a Data Structures and Algorithms class from college (GT). 
The objective was to read in moves in a Chess boardgame and output the final positions of the chess pieces.
PGN (Portable Game Notation) files contain the chess moves in algebraic chess notation.

Steps to run the files:
1. Compile the Java file by running on the command line javac PgnReader.java
2. Run any PGN file by typing in the filename after the java command. ex: java PgnReader petrov-defense.pgn
